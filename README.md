<h1>CSS Practice with Scrimba</h1>

<h2>Adding Transitions</h2>

<h6>Adding the transition element</h6>

>transition "specific value we want to transition" "time it takes to transition in seconds"

<p align="center">An example of css code is given below</p>

```css
.heading {
color: blue;
font-size: 20px;
transition: color 0.5s;
}
```

Here if we want target different properties together we can separate properties by comma or all the properties together

>transition "specific value" "time in sec", "specific value" "time in sec", "more properties" "time in sec"

>transition all "time in sec"


    An example of css code is given below

    ```css
    .heading {
        color: blue;
        font-size: 20px;
        //transition: color 0.5s, font-size 1s;
        //transition: all 0.5s;
    }
    ```
